# learningml_iris
I wanted to learn more about machine learning, so I explored the Iris dataset

I implemented KNN, NN, and SVM classifiers and scored them for the Iris dataset. It's been done before but this is my little introduction to ML. I'm hoping to learn more than how to use sklearn in the future and do bigger and better than plant classification!
